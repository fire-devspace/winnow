/// What bounds one restore-only range scan, and what bounds the restore it is
/// part of.
///
/// This is a fork-local addition, and the caps are the reason it can exist at
/// all. Upstream is forward-only on purpose (docs/mobile.html section 4.1):
/// a wallet scans from its birthday to the tip and never back, because a
/// historical back-scan on a phone is unbounded work on a radio the customer
/// pays for. A restore that has a mnemonic and no wallet file has no birthday
/// to scan forward from, so this fork needs the back-scan — and what makes it
/// something other than the unbounded scan upstream refused is that every
/// dimension of it is capped, by a number that cannot be raised past a hard
/// maximum stated here.
///
/// Each value is clamped to its ceiling on the way in rather than validated,
/// so a caller cannot loosen a cap by asking for more; asking for less always
/// works. The ceilings are:
///
/// - `blocksCeiling`, five years of mainnet blocks at 52,560 a year. A restore
///   range is [birthday, frontier], and Fire's floor for a wallet with no
///   recovery record is the launch height, so five years is comfortably past
///   the oldest range this can be asked for and still refuses a scan of the
///   whole chain.
/// - `scriptsCeiling`, 200 windows of the 100-index restore gap. Matching is
///   linear in the script set for every filter in the range, so this is the
///   cap that decides how much CPU a pass costs.
/// - `filterBytesCeiling`, 1 GiB in one run. What it counts is every byte the
///   run reads off the wire and keeps: the compact filters of the blocks it
///   scans, plus the full blocks their matches pull down. Both are charged to
///   the one budget, because on a restore the blocks are the larger half. A
///   mainnet filter runs 15-20 KB a block and a matched block is up to 4 MB,
///   so the default 64 MiB is roughly 3,500 blocks when nothing matches and
///   fewer as matches accumulate: BIP158 false positives alone are about 1 in
///   40 blocks against a 20,000-script set. `RangeScanOutcome` reports the two
///   halves separately so a caller can see which one it spent.
///
///   The cap is charged after the bytes have arrived, so a run ends slightly
///   past it. The exact worst case is one chunk of filters plus one block:
///   a chunk's filters are charged once the whole chunk has been read and
///   verified, before any of it is matched, which
///   `FilterSync.chunkByteBound(filters:)` bounds at `filtersPerChunk` times
///   1.25 MB (125 MB at the default 100), and a matched block is charged once
///   it has been verified and delivered, bounded by the 4 MB a block message
///   may carry. A real chunk of 100 mainnet filters is under 2 MB.
/// - `durationCeiling`, an hour. Read between batches, before every chunk
///   request, and before every matched block is fetched, so a run overshoots
///   by at most one outstanding peer request; this bounds how long a restore
///   may hold the pool, not how long a request takes.
/// - `iterationsCeiling`, 50 passes over the range. A pass is one fixed-point
///   step: the caller derives more scripts from what the last pass found and
///   scans the range again. Honest restores converge in two or three.
///
/// What bounds the whole restore, rather than one run, is `maxBlocks` and
/// `maxIterations` together. A run that refuses on bytes or time resumes from
/// the last batch that committed, so what it re-reads is the batch it died
/// inside and never the range: the filter traffic of a whole restore is the
/// range read `maxIterations` times, plus one batch for each interruption.

    /// The one case the guard cannot cover is a chain whose tip is below the

    ///
    /// A run interrupted by a cap or a peer fault leaves the record at the
    /// last batch that committed, so the blocks of the batch it died inside
    /// are read again by the next run and their matches delivered again.
    /// `onMatch` must therefore be idempotent per height, which is the same
